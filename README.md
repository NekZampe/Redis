# My Redis Implementation

## Introduction
Welcome to my Redis implementation! This project is inspired by the ["Build Your Own Redis with C/C++"](https://build-your-own.org/redis/) book, which offers a hands-on approach to understanding network programming and data structures. Redis is an in-memory data structure store, commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. Its importance lies in its speed, simplicity, and versatility, making it a vital tool in modern web applications and services.

## What is Redis?
Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source, advanced key-value store that supports various data structures, such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. It is known for its high performance and is often used for caching, session management, real-time analytics, and message queuing. Redis operates primarily in memory, providing faster data access than traditional disk-based databases.

### Why is Redis Important?
- **Performance**: With its in-memory architecture, Redis delivers sub-millisecond response times, making it ideal for high-performance applications.
- **Versatile Data Structures**: Redis supports multiple data types, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate structure for their needs.
- **Scalability**: Redis can handle large volumes of data and is easily scalable, making it suitable for both small applications and large enterprise systems.
- **Persistence Options**: While primarily an in-memory store, Redis offers persistence options to ensure data durability.

## Why Build Redis from Scratch?
- **Hands-On Learning**: This project helps deepen your understanding of network programming and data structures, both essential skills in software development.
- **Create to Understand**: Inspired by Richard Feynman's quote, “What I cannot create, I do not understand,” this project emphasizes learning through creation. Building Redis from the ground up solidifies your knowledge and enhances your problem-solving skills.
- **Master C**: Working with C provides insights into low-level programming, enabling you to appreciate system programming and infrastructure software.

## Project Overview
This implementation is structured into two main parts:

### Part 1: Getting Started
- **Socket Programming Concepts**: Understanding the fundamentals of network communication.
- **TCP Server and Client**: Implementing a simple TCP server and client for data exchange.
- **Protocol Parsing**: Learning how to parse commands and responses.
- **The Event Loop and Nonblocking IO**: Implementing an event loop for handling multiple connections without blocking.
- **Basic Server Functionality**: Implementing basic commands like `GET`, `SET`, and `DEL`.

### Part 2: Essential Topics
- **Data Structures**: Implementing core data structures like hashtables.
- **Data Serialization**: Understanding how to serialize data for efficient storage and retrieval.
- **The AVL Tree**: Implementing and testing an AVL tree for sorted sets.
- **Timers and TTL**: Managing expiration of keys with time-to-live (TTL) functionality.
- **Thread Pool and Asynchronous Tasks**: Enhancing performance through concurrent processing.
